2696508,Mr L,"<p>Programming enthusiast, who is not <strong>great</strong> at coding - but <em>loves</em> it. </p>

<p>Started off in VBA, then moved on to VB.Net. I progressed to C#, which is still one of my all time faves. But spend a lot time lately in Java, developing Android apps. </p>

<p>Have created several websites in my spare time, so a handyman in html and javascript. A few of the sites have web applications, written in ASP.net using Visual Studio.</p>

<p>Design quite a bit of home automation scripts and front ends, mainly on the Raspberry Pi, Alexa, LightwaveRF and SmartThings. So I enjoy Python, Node.Js and Apache Groovy.</p>

<p>Dabbled in Tizen for the Samsung platform, mainly for using my home automation setup on my watch and tv. Don't find Tizen Studio at all easy though, especially after being spoilt with Visual Studio and Android Studio.</p>",,2013-08-19T13:04:26.273Z,2021-08-26T18:46:23.977Z,"Swindon, United Kingdom",290,51,0,28,https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qo8vn.png,

<p>As a primarily autodidactic programmer, I have developed skills to quickly and effectively teach myself new concepts. Considering the intense speed at which technology is progressing, the ability to educate oneself and apply new skills to technological and creative challenges is one of a developer’s most valuable assets.</p>

<p>Even though the creation of software, at its core, is the act of providing a solution to a problem, the manner in which that solution is presented to the user is paramount. It is in this context I feel my analytical and problem solving skills to be most useful. The importance of the user’s experience cannot be overstated in today’s consumer-facing technology market. For software to be truly successful, it must not only provide a brilliant solution to a problem, but also do so with elegance, and inherent ease of use.</p>

<p>The future of the software industry lies at the intersection of the humanities and technology, and I'm thrilled to be a part of it.</p>",,2014-04-29T07:59:28.133Z,2018-05-24T07:19:58.037Z,Indore,99,2,0,35,https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Q1wF.jpg,

5293554,Jan Bergström,"<p>I am an experienced C-programmer (mainly Windows) and with good knowledge of Android Java with JNI (enough to undeliberately gain quite some points in stackoverflow). I also definitely accept jobs working with OSX, iOS and Linux and like HW-near programming. </p>

<p>I have developed a skill of making a C-core for performance and portability and make device dependent user shells. The basic idea is limit risks of bugs, maintenance and fast developing of new apps for a range of OS. As consultant I usually have been working in saving missions. making things work, getting them over the acceptance test level, finalise pushes etc, and like responsibilities. </p>

<p>I have worked a lot in cooperation with marketing and making products fit customer demands and support the marketing in sales missions. I have a very good feeling for what is possible, costs and how good marketing skills are performed. </p>

<p>I am senior  (61 years old) with university degree before IT-educations started with work studies and user behaviour/rationalisation of administrative environments. Worked with frontline tech and learned everything at work and so there is no documentation. In short my CV is not as good as my skill. </p>

<p>I live in Stockholm and intend to continue but I don’t mind travel or working abroad, being fluent in English and German and communicate else, and very good in creating contacts.  </p>

<p>As senior I have difficulties getting missions and employments (due to the CV issue I guess). I am working as a private side project on in getting incomes from accounting in mobile phones in the future (a C-base with device dependent shells). I am very good in business administration and accounting issues. I am not interested in governmental supported employments, because I will not give up my company, Alphabet AB. </p>

<p>I have the last years mainly my income from taxi driving (also being bus driver as a student) and have very low personal costs. This means I have quite some experience in use of transport business apps and think such projects are challenging.</p>",,2015-09-02T16:50:19.457Z,2021-08-23T00:32:59.553Z,"Stockholm, Sweden",586,74,0,135,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-qCDOUHHK7Zo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAF8/n8wutrasmnE/photo.jpg?sz=128,http://www.alphabet.se

<li>Cranking out rapid application development custom apps in Ruby-On-Rails and Java Grails</li>

1504197,Sergii N.,"<h3>Mobile apps developer, devopser and scrumbaner</h3>

<p>I am a mobile apps developer, who loves to communicate with clients, visualize progress and automate as many routine steps as possible. DRY, “keep it simple"" and the boyscout rule (leave code/project/anything cleaner after you, than it was before you) are top priorities for me. I like to find fun and inspiring stuff in what Im doing, as well as look for and accept challenges in any task. One of the principles I am driven by is that nothing is impossible, it’s just a question of how much time it needs and if it’s still relevant after coming up with an estimate.  </p>

<p>I am fond of devopsing and gathering puzzles of continuous integration, continuous delivery and their fellows. I strongly believe that manual work should be excluded from routine and repeatable stages of anything we do. All steps from dev commit and up to the app being on on users device should work automagically.  </p>

<p>I am <a href=""https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/profile/snezdoliy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Certified Scrum Master</a>, which helps me to understand why it is important to adapt Scrum/Kanban processes for each customer and determine best practices which can be reused for different projects. I find it crucial to make project development and progress clear and visible to all the participants.</p>",,2012-07-05T13:48:21.950Z,2021-09-02T15:56:34.340Z,"Stockholm, Sweden",305,124,1,62,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/sergiinezdolii

<p>3 He created everything there is—nothing exists that he didn’t make. </p>

<p>4 Eternal life is in him, and this life gives light to all mankind.</p>

<p>5 His life is the light that shines through the darkness—and the darkness can never extinguish it.</p>

<p><strong>Amplified Bible Classic Edition (AMPC)</strong></p>

<p>In the beginning [before all time] was the Word (Christ), and the Word was with God, and the Word was God Himself.</p>

<p>2 He was present originally with God.</p>

<p>3 All things were made and came into existence through Him; and without Him was not even one thing made that has come into being.</p>

<p>4 In Him was Life, and the Life was the Light of men.</p>

<p>5 And the Light shines on in the darkness, for the darkness has never overpowered it [put it out or absorbed it or appropriated it, and is unreceptive to it].</p>",,2014-05-24T10:37:06.247Z,2021-09-04T07:33:38.130Z,Kenya,3175,86,1,577,https://i.stack.imgur.com/qWe9e.png,

<p>I am a senior developer with over 12 years experience. I specialise in short-term contracts. Remote and part-time contracts are preferred but on-site and full-time is also possible and I recognise that on-site is often desired during initial contracts to build trust.</p>

<p>My somewhat unusual approach of specialising in this way is driven by my lifestyle which includes periods of time overseas and/or in meditation.</p>

<ul>
<li>Thinking about user experience and drawing very user-friendly
application mock-ups (especially when I can cut down on features or
reduce the number of clicks/taps). </li>
<li>Turning the good-looking designs into actual working programs.</li>
<li>Critising my own code and refactoring to make it better (well at least I think so).</li>
<li>Automating tasks whenever possible.  </li>
<li>Sharing knowlege on stackoverflow, even better if it earns points :-).</li>
<li>Designing microservices that are highly scalable.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Complete Story</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Part 1: Back to Basics</strong></p>

<p>I worked on Symbian which got deprecated. Then I started learning <em>Java</em>, <em>C++</em> and <em>C</em> to create some cool simple software(s) to make my life easier using the Desktop Machine. Slowly I started feeling that there would be lots of people who might make use of my softwares designed but I was immature at that time and didn't have internet at home.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Part 2: Joining College and Falling in Love with Android</strong></p>

<p>I started with Computer Engineering where I got to learn Databases like MySQL, Mongo and Hadoop, Java-EE and few small things and make more better software to help people out. But I wanted to do something more hence I started learning Android individually. </p>

<p>I started with Android app development without having Internet at my home. Currently it's been more than 3.5 years since I started. My goal is to make <em>my life</em> easier and then my first <em>useful app</em> <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=aky.akshay.coveralgorithm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""Automaton Locker"">Automaton Locker <em>Play Store link</em></a>, it is on Play Store with more than <strong>1 Lakh downloads</strong>. I got lots of help from XDA-Developers too and I fell in love with Android :)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Part 3: Continued Making great Android apps</strong></p>

<p>I didn't stop with my first app. I made lots of quality apps and I'm always backed by my friends even I've never met some of them in real. <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=aj.jair.music"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""Jair Player"">Jair Music Player</a> is one of them and now it has more than <strong>300K+ downloads</strong>. </p></li>

Кто не изменит нам один?
Кто все дела, все речи мерит
Услужливо на наш аршин?
Кто клеветы про нас не сеет?
Кто нас заботливо лелеет?
Кому порок наш не беда?
Кто не наскучит никогда?
Призрака суетный искатель,
Трудов напрасно не губя,
Любите самого себя,
Достопочтенный мой читатель!
Предмет достойный: ничего
Любезней верно нет его.</p>

7710739,Reejesh PK,"<p>Basically loved Science and used to dismantle everything that i got from childhood, which usually all kids do, but i was lucky to get whole lot of stuff to dismantle and study. Then, as i saw computers, eventually fell in love with it, being a 90's kid, having a chance to use Computers at an early stage, thanks to my Schools, and my Parents. I still loved hardware and troubleshooting. Then, an introduction to programming, and my mind was blown, so took up a course i was interested in, and now currently working as an Android Developer!</p>

<p>About myself, i was an introvert, but my friends opened the box I was enclosed in, set me free and made me a complete Human. And i love nature and animals. Wish to live like cave men. And wisdom gained through my course of life, till now, is that Farming is the best thing to do, and the moral that i learnt is that: ""Don't buy food, Grow Food"", its the direct way! Why go for Money->Food? Just go straight at it! </p>

<p>So I'm concerned with plantation and growing our own food! Hope everyone understands the need for food!</p>",,2017-03-14T18:45:27.300Z,2021-09-02T18:20:41.170Z,India,508,3824,1,143,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-WNwGOqi98xc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAALQ/Mxny-Hg7VAk/photo.jpg?sz=128,https://cavemanbacktocave.blogspot.com/

2840837,Lee Hounshell,"<p>I am interested in remote work Android Developer opportunities.</p>

<p>I completed my Certified Android Developer Nano degree from Udacity+Google on July 28, 2016.</p>

<p>I'm a highly experienced Senior Software Engineer, proficient in a range of technologies.
Since 2015, I've successfully transitioned my career from Backend Developer to Android Developer.</p>

<p>I bring years of software development experience, and an awareness of perspective, helping teams with design and implementation of systems, worldwide. I am a positive, professional team player with proven record of excellence and dependability.</p>

<p>I first started programming using small machines back in high-school: Intel 8080 machine-language in the late 70's, then a programmable TI-59 calculator and an Apple II - which I traded my first car for. Those machines also had very limited resources. Working with Android reminds me of those days, as it can be a challenge to turn ideas into working systems. My choice of Android as a career direction is greatly complemented by my experience designing and building large systems. And it's just plain fun.</p>

<p>• Specialties:
Android App Development - see examples of my work at <a href=""https://github.com/leehounshell"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/leehounshell</a>
Hi-performance network programming, Linux, C, C++, J2EE, Python, Hadoop
Hi-performance scalable backend creation in C, C++, Java and Python
3D animation</p>

<p>• Notable Accomplishments:
 I recently designed, built and programmed an Android controlled robot with AI vision and speech recognition ability.</p>

<p>I built a Python and C++ system for ‘device ID flattening and lookup’ across 2 billion devices on 64 Postgres shards.</p>

<p>I built a custom RHEL5 64-bit Linux kernel with a custom ioctl API, modifications for TCP/IP performance, TCP options control, and number of connections.</p>

<p>I co-designed and built a high-performance scalable Linux web server in 'C' that is able to look-up, transform, serve and log 50K transactions per second (average latency of 20 microseconds).</p>",,2013-10-03T01:27:50.493Z,2021-09-02T18:13:04.310Z,"San Francisco, CA",734,189,2,274,https://i.stack.imgur.com/YLA22.jpg?s=128&g=1,http://harlie.com

I am currently working with Objective C and Swift programming languages in XCode 7 and 8 under iOS Development. I am adept at using several software design patterns and have extensive knowledge of creating applications for mobile platforms I have managed all aspects of application development, from requirement gathering to publishing the product to the app stores. I have good understanding of web technologies and their integration with mobile clients.</p>

<p>Apart from development a major portion of my role remained as a team lead. I have spent time being a team lead for mobile platform as well as technical lead for iOS team in my recent projects. To keep up with the latest trends in respective development and share my knowledge I spend my time on Stackoverflow and write my own blog.</p>

<p>As a student I have a good record I completed my education with distinction, securing first position amongst my batch and received gold medal from prime minister of Pakistan.</p>

<p>I would like to proceed working with Objective C / Swift on challenging iOS projects. So a position of Sr. iOS Developer, iOS Developer and technical lead will suit me.

I can also make web apps with angular and games with Unity. I also did an ethical hacking course from udemy. I also did a basic course of machine learning.</p>
<p>My story --
I just completed internship in a medical college (for MBBS degree). I chose biology in my 11th std. In my 2nd year of college, I realized that I chose a wrong career path. Programming is my passion but I chose biology because both my parents are doctors. In 2nd yr, I decided that I will not continue the medical field and will do programming.</p>
<p>I started doing online courses on coursera (on audit). By now, I have completed more than 25 courses on coursera (on audit) for topics including android app development, front-end and back-end web development, algorithms and data structures, game development with Unity, machine learning, neural networks with deep learning, ethical hacking.</p>

<p>Colleagues know me as a highly creative developer who can always be trusted to come up with a new approach. But I know that the client’s business comes first, and I never try to impose my ideas on others. Instead, I spend a lot of time understanding the business and the audience before suggesting ideas. I can (and often do) work well alone, but I’m at my best collaborating with others.</p>
<p>I have a BA in computer science from the University of Assiut.</p>
<p>Currently, I’m working as an android developer in KlLLIQ company I'm responsible for defining the technical architecture, like use MVVM architecture pattern or using MVP pattern I never try to impose my ideas on others.
But I just make things clear so I’m select a pattern based on the specific case of the project so if the project has long term capability so that need a pattern that supports scalability such as MVVM although I’m picking a technology stack such as what is the best technology to make network requests is that retrofit, and finally define the development of milestones,

As a programmer there is nothing I can't do... apart from change the world, which hasn't released it's source code yet!</p>

<h1>android development</h1>

<p>I specialise in building high quality Google Android apps. I have been learning and developing apps using Android since Google launched the mobile operating system in late 2008. Google has created an extremely powerful platform with which to build even more powerful apps.</p>

<p>I have a great passion for creating excellent apps for Android, utilising Google's best practices and development guidelines. By creating apps in this way and using the Android UI components, my apps will look and behave identically across all handsets and tablets.</p>

<h1>web development</h1>

<p>My web development expertise lies within PHP (Object-Oriented), Symfony PHP framework and Magento (eCommerce platform). I have built a large amount of websites, starting from small personal sites, up to large multi-million pound ecommerce websites.</p>

<p>I'm always keeping up to date with the latest web technologies and standards. I'm a firm believer in using the best available technologies that enable me to create great websites and web applications. Symfony is the perfect framework for developing web applications quickly, easily and securely.</p>",,2011-02-10T17:50:41.500Z,2021-09-04T14:38:34.880Z,"Winchester, United Kingdom",3768,37,3,79,,https://robholmes.app

Brazilian, descendant of Japanese, had the privilege to work abroad in Santiago de Chile for 6 months, a few weeks in San Francisco and another few in India. As a kid, I grew up in a corporate environment all the while playing with a MSX (Basic programming language). I like to think that I'm much more than a software engineer, since I love to solve any kind of problems (either social or computational) and I like to think about technologies only as an auxiliary tool, only a part of the complex that is to solve real problems in the real world. Slow processes bore me and therefore I am devotee of agile methodologies. Last but not least, I believe in creating value by investing more in people and less on tools and bureaucracies.</p>",,2011-02-10T12:50:26.203Z,2021-08-30T17:34:49.563Z,"Belo Horizonte, Brazil",775,74,3,118,,http://paulononaka.wordpress.com

4146780,Hirak Chhatbar,"<p>I recently completed my MBBS. Sometimes, destiny doesn't let you follow your passion. So I decided to respect them both.</p>

<p>I am a self taught Android developer. I started freelancing along side my MBBS studies in 2014. During these years, I helped number of startups to help them establish their business. The more familiar I became with startup ecosystem, the more I wanted to explore. Decoding ECGs and Coding Applications became my favorite routine.</p>

<p>In a bid to discover all that my brain has to offer, I turned into an Entrepreneur. I have my own startups, which are playing well in their respective fields. Dad has given me so much that it belittled my pursuit. I had no other option than be an entrepreneur while being a doc.</p>

<p>My other hobbies, just like any other Indian 90's kid, include playing cricket. It's apparently difficult for a doc to be a cricketer or I wouldn't have been an entrepreneur.
Reading isn't my thing (except for those thick medical books), but I love to write. I can pen down ordinary words in extra ordinary ways.</p>

<p>Currently, I am looking for talented wanderers (Developers, Graphic Designers and Social Media Managers) who are willing to join me on my journey. I am also looking for Investors for my startup.
I am willing to take opportunities of joining Startups as a Co founder.</p>

<p>You can reach me on WhatsApp @ 7820065248 or send a message here.
P.S. - I don't take consultation fees (yet).</p>",,2014-10-15T18:00:21.697Z,2021-09-04T16:17:58.017Z,"Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India",2991,70,4,335,https://i.stack.imgur.com/yVE4Q.jpg,https://www.xcitech.in

Over the last twelve years, I have developed numerous softwares in; Java, .NET and Android Platforms.</p>

<p>Whilst working for Yapi Kredi Koray Facility Management Inc. as IT manager (2007-2009), I was awarded in the category of “Innovative IT Application’’ by Euromoney.
Post military service, I worked as a consultant for PCIS Consulting whom provide support and consultancy to large international companies such as; Phillip Morris, BASF and Akcansa.

<p>I am an active member of Support for Modern Life Association and Android Platform Application Developers Group.</p>

<p>For the last 14 years I have played guitar and I sing and write music as a passionate hobby. In my spare time I love to challenge myself with intellectual topics and research science and world history. I love science fiction and am a avid cinema, film and book fan.

2089675,smac89,"<h2>General Tips:</h2>
<p>The act of asking a question when you are stuck has two advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>The process of forming the question has a high chance of leading you to the answer, so you may end up never having to ask your question</li>
<li>By converting a problem into a question, you no longer have a problem, instead you now have a question, and someone is bound to have an answer!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Software eng tip(s):</h2>
<ul>
<li>When assigned the task of implementing a new feature or improving an existing one, consult your nearest domain expert before consulting Google. A domain expert could be a co-worker with experience in that area, or whoever had worked on the feature you are trying to improve.
<ul>
<li>When a domain expert does not exist, then you and your team are in no position to undertake such a task. Forget Google at this point, you all need to have a serious meeting to determine a new solution for the task at hand.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As a new developer, practice the art of asking questions. If you go three days working on a ticket and never ask a question, you are in danger of making a costly mistake.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Random</h2>
<ul>
<li>Every local variable is a global variable with limited scope.</li>

<p>The source of all bugs is referencing yourself to an object, all bugs extend from this bug,since you only read the objects that extend from your referenced object , debugging this can happen through tracing your root context until you are completely unreferenced ,then as you unbind yourself from the thread of objects, up-casting to more polymorphic ones ,you trace yourself back to the super object, &quot;I&quot; (the architect of the matrix) ,if you unbind from that, you merge with the thread, revealing yourself to yourself as the very fabric from which all software comes and goes.</p>",,2017-02-12T09:37:05.557Z,2021-08-31T09:09:55.367Z,Egypt,377,58,5,261,https://i.stack.imgur.com/RxUnX.png?s=128&g=1,https://thedaybydaydeveloper.blogspot.com/

<p>Android Interview Questions:</p>

<p>can we get phone number?
difference between v4 and v7?
how to restrict application only for tablets not for mobiles?             in Manifest  supports-screens and compatible-screens
how can upload more than 50 MB apk on play store?
worked with animation in android?
what information we can retrieve from other apps in device?   (use requiresSmallestWidthDp in above 3.2)</p>

<p>why we use ViewHolder in Android?
What is difference between aggregation and composition?</p>

<p>Aggregation represents weak relationship whereas composition represents strong relationship. 
For example: bike has an indicator (aggregation) but bike has an engine (compostion).</p>

<p>Can we override static method?
No, you can't override the static method because they are the part of class not object. </p>

652410,eoinzy,"<p>I am a mobile developer from Ireland interested in Android mainly. I learned my trade with C initially, then tried VB6 (which I didn't think too much of), then went on to C++, while briefly touching a few other languages on the side, namely HTML, PHP, MySQL, perl, python, ASP, ASP.NET.
I enjoy web programming on occasion, but I am really interested in mobile development. Initially, I learned the basics of iPhone/Ojective-C, but since getting my first Android in 2011, I got into Android development and have really taken a shine to it. I have also written code for Blackberry devices.
I don't have any java background so I'm happy to learn java via Android. I enjoy it and think it's fun.</p>

<p>As part of a previous college project, I started a blog to keep track of what I have learned. I don't get much visits but it's meant more as a potential addition to my resumé, if I manage to write anything of note!!

Nowadays, since &quot;programmer&quot; became &quot;Oh, you can make me a website, then?&quot;
I have taken on a few extra languages, Python (still my fav scripting lang), Perl, Java, Scala, and the obligatory JavaScript. Server-side JS (Node), Java, C#.
Serious side, I work in regularly in React, Vue, native Android, some native iOS, and all mobile frameworks.
I'm GCP and AWS friendly, tolerate Azure, am very experienced with Linux and too many flavors of Database (NoSQL, PostgreSQL, Mysql, and of course SQL, Redis) and, I'm a ML hobbyist.

1002898,Shittu Joseph Olugbenga,"<p>I once dreamt of becoming a medical doctor to save lives, but ever since I wrote my first BASIC code to solve a 3x3 matrices, coding has becoming an essential part of my life, giving me a new mission. Coding is what I do to calm down when tension runs high. My passion for coding keeps me coding every day ever since with the believe that I can literally change the world for the better.</p>
<p>I am NOW a developer on a mission to make the world a better place.</p>
<p>To achieve my mission, I try to:<br />
➤ Be PASSIONATE about what I do. There can never be success without passion.<br />
➤ Give extreme ATTENTION TO DETAILS. Hence, I write elegant codes that are maintainable and well thought out, considerably reducing technical debt to the barest minimum.<br />
➤ LEARN and keep learning fast. Great leaders are good learners. My aim is to get the work done. Hence, I am willing to learn any technology, and learn from people around me as well.<br />
➤ COACH others. I can’t change the world alone. I need to validate what I know and still impact knowledge. Some of my trainees are already full-time developers.</p>
<p>My first paid job was a test of my passion, attention to details and creativity. I created a web application that the company used for outsourcing jobs. The application was in use both in Nigeria and in India, and it generated good revenue for the company. While my next job tested my ability to learn and adapt in an unfamiliar industry. The application I built helped curbed fraudulent activities that has been ongoing in the company, and increased the company’s monthly income by over 7 million naira.  Also, I architected a SaaS application to manage a logistic ecosystem, which has increased clients’ revenue and accountability among clients’ staff members.</p>
<p>To keep my wit as one on a mission, I found it difficult to stop coding even on weekends and during the night. My life revolves around coding. I recently reviewed a code (<a href=""https://www.lenda.ng/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.lenda.ng/</a>) and the client reported a 30% increase in the performance of the application. I have been part of several entrepreneurial drives in recent years. I WANT TO MAKE THE WORLD BETTER.</p>
<p>I strongly believe in building lasting relationship with everyone I cross path with. Most of my bosses and colleagues (both past and present) are my friends. I believe I cannot survive without people. Hence, I look forward to meeting and working with new people. There are lots to learn from others.</p>

<p>Prior recent experience developing similar apps as both Chrome packaged apps and Web apps, using Java and GWT.</p>

<p>Career-long involvement with AI programming methods, including rule-based systems, mainly as an ancillary approach.  These methods are applied as needed to accomplish specific tasks within apps that are mostly of a more conventional nature, with ""grey box"" human interaction and direction of the AI code emphasized over autonomous decision making on the part of that code.</p>

<p>I also have extensive past experience with programming in primarily rule-based languages, including ART (Automated Reasoning Tool), and have fairly recent experience in maintaining a legacy Expert System that uses that approach, but now believe that development using conventional languages with specific embedded AI modules written in those same languages is, in most cases, a more useful approach.</p>",,2011-09-04T23:31:09.943Z,2019-04-30T23:58:44.633Z,"Los Angeles, CA",14955,193,8,1025,,http://www.goalstate.com/fullboard.html

533549,Andy,"<p>I use programming as a tool for creating new systems and services. I know most modern programming languages, but I am not programmer; I focus on functionality and the invention of new products. I am expert (PhD) in most aspects of Information Technology, with 20 years experience in Research and Development. Ask me about ad hoc networking, mesh networking and delay tolerant networks, or any networking specific technology, and I will know the answer. I also work with security and encryption.</p>

<p>My preferred languages are Java and C as mostly create web services, network protocols and backend services. With these two, or combined, you can create almost anything unless you platform or environment prevents you from it (iOS). I am comfortable with Python, and use it for advanced administrative purposes; starting and stopping services, boot up VMs, databases etc. Python is very powerful, and while it can be used for creating great small programs, I believe it should preferably not be used that way, but rather as a super scripting language. For text parsing, and other parsing tasks, I mainly use Perl, but may sometimes also use Python for this.
I have written lots of code in C++, but I really do not like it.</p>",,2010-12-07T10:51:50.310Z,2021-09-03T18:17:08.797Z,World,2350,343,9,244,,

147175,Scott Stensland,"<p>in the language go wrote a system to translate an input image into its audio equivalent where none of the information is thrown away ... it parses the image at the pixel level starting in one corner and traversing a path using a Hilbert Curve to visit each pixel and record light intensity at each pixel ... now you have an array of light intensity values ... assign to one end of this array a low frequency within the human audible range ... give other end of array a very high frequency and give each array element inbetween a frequency inbetween ... synthesize an audio oscillator at each element at its given frequency and drive its amplitude by the light intensity at that element ... aggregate all those oscillators into a single raw audio curve in PCM format ... this is the audio output equivalent to the input image ... it performs the functional equivalent to an inverse Fourier Transform ... this half of the system is done</p>
<p>now instead of having an input image synthesize and output audio write a new golang server to implement the reverse of above system namely have this second server input audio to synthesize and output image</p>
<p>so first server does :  imageA --&gt; audioA
second server does :  audioB -&gt; imageB</p>
<p>when I was able to tie those system together such that the audioA output of first server was used as input audioB of second server and the output imageB matched the original input imageA I knew the system worked ...  I have this all working ... next step is to productionize this and make available to the blind ( it may allow the blind to see with their ears ) ... and visa versa for the deaf ... also looking into other uses</p>",,2009-07-29T14:42:57.333Z,2021-09-04T12:51:51.680Z,"New York, United States",23285,7196,13,3196,https://i.stack.imgur.com/PyWe3.jpg?s=128&g=1,https://github.com/scottstensland

1359578,Andrew Senner,"<p>Since I was very young, computers have been a passion of mine. I was always fascinated at how a user could interact with what was on the screen using their mouse and keyboard and the computer would then, in turn, deliver results based on the interaction. I specifically remembered wondering ""How does that work?"" and ""Could I do something like that?""</p>

<p>When I turned fourteen, in my freshman year of high school, I started messing with html. I spent hours on the computer shaping and forming my first web page. When it was finished, I knew I was hooked. The fact that I could turn simple words into this amazing page on the screen amazed me, and so started my experience with web design.</p>

<p>Over the years I expanded my knowledge base and started learning more languages. I started with PHP and MySQL, and turned that static page into a dynamic creation that could respond to user interactions. I then moved on to JavaScript and CSS, and eventually moved on to Java and Android development.</p>

<p>So I hope you enjoy the portfolio and if it peaks your interest, feel free to contact me using the form below. </p>

463053,ChuongPham,"<p>As of <strong>July 11th 2015</strong> Australian EST, I have stopped my entire participation in all S.O. sites due to unwarranted accusations towards me from S.O. moderators. The irony: I don't even give a s**t about the reputation points I have earned so far at S.O., let alone being accused of colluding with others to gain a [pathetic] 370 reputation points (sic!). Special thanks to <code>BalusC</code>, <code>McDowell</code>, <code>Matt Handy</code> and a handful of others who have helped me here. <strong>Sayonara my friends</strong>, I will miss you.</p>

<p>As of <strong>December 18th 2014</strong> Australian EST, I have stopped flagging posts here at S.O. as I can see that the whole moderator process is totally broken. This <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27526219/uninstall-chainfire-3d-on-android"">post</a>, like others taken from my flagging history, shows that while my comment for the post was <em>""This post should be moved to android.stackexchange.com.""</em> was marked as <em>""declined - a moderator reviewed your flag, but found no evidence to support it""</em>, and yet this <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/users/1288/bill-the-lizard"">poster</a> commented the same thing as I said, as in: <em>""You might find some help on Android Enthusiasts""</em>. Go figure! If you read the post properly, it would be best moved to <em>android.stackexchange.com</em> so other people can help the OP since it's not a programming question per se, but it's Android related.</p>

<p>Anyway, it's time I let other S.O. participants get annoyed by this moderator process. I have had enough!</p>

As soon as clients' apps have been migrated / substituted with OpenSource alternatives, Windoze machine will go to the guillotine (figuratively, of course).</p>

<p>The main reason I moved to S.O. is because Sun's (now Oracle's) forums are plagued with too many nitwits and prigs (American English: self-centered pricks).

<p>El universo (que otros llaman la Biblioteca) se compone de un número
indefinido, y tal vez infinito, de galerías hexagonales, con vastos
pozos de ventilación en el medio, cercados por barandas bajísimas.
Desde cualquier hexágono, se ven los pisos inferiores y superiores:
interminablemente. La distribución de las galerías es invariable.
Veinte anaqueles , a cinco largos anaqueles por lado, cubren todos los
lados menos dos ; su altura, que es la de los pisos, excede apenas la
de un bibliotecario normal. Una de las caras libres da a un angosto
zaguán, que desemboca en otra galería, idéntica a la primera y a

<p>Since I have started ios and android app development, I have been spending every spare minute writing code for iPhone and Android and learning everything on mobile application development.
additionally, to development of new apps, a lot of the work I do is on-going maintenance of existing popular apps.</p>

<p>I always aim to maintain a long team relationship with my clients. whether you've lost your original developer, need additional resources, or want a brand new app, I can step in and take over wherever you need.</p>

1403997,4gus71n,"<p>Java developer with experience in SpringMVC, Hibernate and mobile techs (Android, Phonegap / Apache Cordova, Xamarin).</p>

<p>I've worked with Spring building RESTful web apps. I worked with technologies that follows MVC patterns (SpringMVC), MVP(GWT) and MVVM (Angular.js).</p>

<p>The frontend apps that I code are manily Android apps or stateless html clients done with HTML + Javascript if the SEO isn't that important. I prefer coding stateless clients because It makes easier to add new features in the future also It makes easier to deploy the fronend as a cross-platform app using technologies like Apache Cordova / Phonegap</p>

<p>The Android apps that I coded are manily RESTful web apps clients. I've developed Android apps that used background services. I use the latest and more known Android librearies to perform the HTTP request, store data in the device and simplify the overall logic.</p>

<p>I started developing Android apps several years ago when Android was in the 2.2 version and I followed all the Android evolution until now with Marshmellow. I developed apps with differents base architectures. I developed apps that followed an MVP pattern, generally using libraries such as Dagger to perform the dependency injection and glue together all the app components. I also used Lightcycle (the reecently released SoundCloud library) in order to decouple the Fragments/Activities logic into differents classes. I worked in projects using RxJava. I follow every Material Design standar. I always use the latest Android SDK components, for example I no longer use ListViews, instead I use RecyclerViews, I use only Toolbars, I try to improve the UX by using only the latest components. I try to keep the app's code clean and readable. I use every tool at my disposal to keep my code readable so It can be easly understood by my coworkers, //regions, JavaDoc, really really descriptive names.</p>

<p>About project administrations tools I used Jira, Redmine and Trello. I always encouraged the simplification in this process, there's nothing more annoying that having ten communication channels in a team of four. I always belived that using Slack helps a lot to bust a team performance, since that it helps to bind toghether all the adminsitrations tools making the team communication much more fluent.</p>

<p>I've also experience with PHP doing webscrapping and frontend development using CodeIgniter.
I've work with several devs in USA so I can communicate fluently and without problem with other devs or clients.</p>",,2012-05-18T17:48:00.507Z,2021-09-02T15:05:50.980Z,"La Plata, Argentina",4165,317,27,840,https://i.stack.imgur.com/J3c6E.jpg?s=128&g=1,https://github.com/4gus71n

<p>I started an android blog a few months ago and I have been adding videos on how to accomplish simple features in a short amount of time in Android.  I got the idea to even incorporate the videos in the development of applications I would later distribute.</p>

<p>My idea was to join together with other developers and work on creating a community where we could work together to help produce better and better products that consumers will actually use.</p>

Black as the pit from pole to pole,
I thank whatever gods may be

I have not winced nor cried aloud.

My head is bloody, but unbowed.</p>

Looms but the Horror of the shade,
And yet the menace of the years
Finds and shall find me unafraid.</p>

How charged with punishments the scroll,
I am the master of my fate:
I am the captain of my soul.</p>

 anything, it was not good. In fact, it was cringe-worthy bad, and I had never been so proud of anything in my life. It’s been such an
 enjoyable ride since then, doing what I love for a living and
 constantly learning more about it.
I now have over 5 years’ experience in the development of web
and mobile applications, both in frontend and backend side. I have an extensive knowledge of most used web technologies
and frameworks such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Angular JS,
Typescript, Node JS, Mongo DB, among many others. I’ve also been a part of a variety of demanding projects, ranging from
small, local endeavors, to complex, international platforms and highly customized migrations working with Agile
Methodologies.
I’ve tried my hand at a number of challenges, becoming more flexible and versatile with every new lesson learnt. I’ve
realized I’m most comfortable working in any-size international teams, as I’ve found I thrive in a collaborative environment</p>",,2013-07-25T20:48:21.410Z,2021-06-05T14:41:01.237Z,"Rosario, Argentina",1496,145,61,278,https://i.stack.imgur.com/voJKZ.jpg,http://huskysoftware.com.ar

<p>Had my fun with a lot of customer assistance (technical and not) on all platforms (Windows, Linux, MacOS, BlackBerry) both on mobile and non-mobile platforms.</p>
<p>Have been taught the hard way system administration for windows platform, both in software architecture (managing server, AD, SQL Server DBA, Installing/recovering OS and so on) and hardware (Cisco mainly, but I've put my hands on a lot of different brands of NAS, Switches, APs, routers and so on) and more particular hardware (Motorola and other Barcode readers, Zebra/Toshiba label printers, serial/ethernet converters, arduino/raspberry), while being the &quot;computer guy&quot; for a big manifacturing company which needed to bring up heavy informatization on its manifacturing process.

3681880,Suragch,"<p>One of the happiest development choices I've made is learning <a href=""https://flutter.dev/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Flutter</a>. Instead of developing separate Android and iOS apps now, I just make one Flutter app and compile it down to native code for both platforms. For that reason, I'm not actively maintaining my old Android and iOS answers, so feel free to make updates to them yourself, even to the code (preferably testing that your changes work). I am trying to maintain my Flutter answers, so please leave a comment when you find a mistake or shortcoming.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My name is Rene Dohan, professional software developer originally from Slovakia. I have
broad scale of abilities and I make and did
software, such as native mobile applications for iOS and Android,
progressive web apps in typescript and Vue,
backend development mostly Java/Kotlin and desktop apps as well (Various platforms).
Now I am focused on Android and iOS.
I am potentially open for new projects and long term cooperation if I can work
independently or as a project lead developer.
I always have some projects ongoing, but I am able to handle multiple distinct projects,
if I am in charge of whole codebase I work on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>I like to work focused on product success, take it as my own and improve and suggest and build to de best possible quality and detail I currently am able to. I love to use new software technologies and frameworks, but always looking to no over-complicate things, make logic simple, readable and easy to understand next time I will have to look at it, what is good for others as well. I like to create long term relations/conEdence with clients/companies I am working with. Dealing with people with respect is priority, but also with focus on delivery of quality product, so to express valuable opinions even if different from others is a must. With my nomad style of living, I prefer remote positions, currently I am in Mexico. Favorite editor: Android Studio, AppCode/Xcode, IntelliJIdea • First computer: Intel 386 SX</strong></p>
<p><em>When I was 15 years old I bought my first Intel 386 SX in Vancouver, Canada and brought it to Bratislava.and it stopped working suddenly. I completely disassembled it and found factory defect in power supply.I was able to Exit actually and I re-assembled the computer while studying all parts, later some years I actually broke it when changing some pc part.</em></p>
<p><em>When I was 16 I already started doing some software development so to speak, it was computer virus in assembler.The basic idea was to promote some Anarcho-Communistic ideology to computer users, by forcing them to respond to some simple questions about how ideal world should be like.
For wrong answers there was prepared surprise of complete wiping of both FAT tables, that cause almost unrepairable data los.Thanks god the reproduction/copy routine was not so good written and I subsequently gave up on idea altogether.
I also played a little with pascal but then abandoned software development and focused on computer hardware and playing games. I then fallen in love with computer hardware, tuning of by bios configurations to accelerate PC and hardware cooling etc, until some years later I came back to software again in one of my first jobs.</em></p>",,2011-09-02T11:14:15.697Z,2021-09-05T05:09:18.587Z,"Playa del Carmen, Quintana Roo, Mexico",4557,564,76,660,https://i.stack.imgur.com/a9Ris.jpg,https://renetik.com

<p>I used StackOverflow for years with the best vibes I could bring until one day I had enough and decided to become selfish with it. Too many people here are more obsessed about internal guidelines and silly form-related stuff than they are about solving problems and helping people (lot of similarities with government bureaucracies). Therefore I decided I will no longer come here to contribute, but only to ask selfishly and leave.</p>
<p>Stop rating people down out of form/guidelines nonsense when they help others. You ruin the whole purpose it was first intended for. If you're frustrated about life go for a workout instead, go argue and click frown icons on social media, or make a couple of left swipes on Tinder.</p>",,2013-12-15T19:43:08.833Z,2021-08-31T19:06:11.450Z,"Los Angeles, CA, USA",1850,175,91,284,https://i.stack.imgur.com/eSikW.png?s=128&g=1,https://florianbador.com

<p><strong>I thought I was pretty aware</strong> years ago... </p>

<p>You know - well educated, <em>big student</em> (of) science, metaphysics all my life, studied different religions and so forth.</p>

<p><strong>but I hit a brick wall</strong> eventually..., </p>

<p>in terms of what my intellect would do and I really <em>had no frame of reference</em>. </p>

<p><strong>but I was seeking</strong> ...</p>

<p>i was one of those people in life who <em>was always searching</em>. And the big surprise for me was <strong>the experience of awareness</strong> that really knows that there's a presence within you - that you can <em>rely on</em>, that you can <em>take solace in</em>, that you can <em>take comfort in</em>, that gives you a well spring of love, that lets you know that</p>

<p><strong>you don't have to seek for the things that we're taught to seek for outside of yourself</strong>. </p>

3749773,Alireza,"<p>Everything started with blogging and exploring Windows XP but learning computer programming happened in 2008 while exploring the Parand King Software Collection. Beloved web development filled my whole time for 6 years, but I only try to keep my knowledge up to date these days. I’ve developed two simple desktop applications with C#. In brief, because of my curiosity, I try many things out and now over 4 years past since I left in love with mobile application programming. It seems Blockchain would be the next.</p>

<p>I prefer to work as a freelancer, but I certainly very much enjoy working with others; I enjoy the team spirit and I'm understanding of the needs of others. I'm good at helping the team to see the bigger picture – to see the wood from the trees – helping them to focus on what really matters rather than getting bogged down in irrelevant detail.
I'm an engineer who can handle all the work of databases, servers, systems engineering, and clients. Depending on the project, what customers need may be a mobile stack, a web stack, or a native application stack. I'm a full-stack developer.</p>

<p>I follow new technologies and keep technical knowledge up-to-date as well as read management, marketing, and startups related stuff and really hard trying to improve own individual skills. Medium.com, JournalDev.com, Vogella.com, Chetor.com, and Virgool.io are favored resources to learn and try new stuff; I also don't miss any number of subscribed weekly newsletters.</p>

<p>I apply to companies that help me to improve my productivity and creativity. So, startups and small teams are my preferred options most of the time.</p>",,2014-06-17T18:36:22.143Z,2021-04-28T09:11:29.453Z,"Tehran, Tehran Province, Iran",1360,1174,106,281,https://i.stack.imgur.com/om7u6.jpg?s=128&g=1,

<p>I got serious about coding with the release of the Android handsets.  Serious by my standards meant inquisitive or intrigued ... I have always written code in one form or another, but I really, really long for a development job.  I grew up when id Software was in its infancy and writing games was the coolest thing you could do.  I started through Head First Java.  It's a great book.  I also purchased and started watching O'Reilly's Developing Android Apps with Java video series.  Also good.</p>

<p>The problem is I don't learn in that way.  I learn by doing, but I really had nothing to do.  I was approached out of the blue in January 2011 by a Realtor based in NY.  He wanted an application that would allow him to send a large number of people an SMS message.  Direct Marketing.  Ugh.  I hadn't touched Android or Java in almost a year.  But thanks to Stuttering John Smith here I am.  Almost 1 month into the release of my own app I have 1,500 downloads with 500 active installations.

<p>I used to script almost exclusively in Perl, but a couple of years ago I discovered the wonders of PowerShell, and have since fallen in love with it.</p>

<p>Why am I here? Because I greatly enjoy problem-solving, and I find that I vastly increase my knowledge and well-roundedness by figuring out other people's problems. I started answering questions mainly because I wanted to gain 50 rep points so I could post comments, and, well, as you see on the left I kind of overshot my goal a little bit...okay, I got addicted. I really should see someone about this...</p>

<p>[If you're asking yourself, ""WTF? This all sounds strangely out of context for this site. Is this guy on crack??"", the answer is no. This profile was written for Stack Overflow, but apparently it automatically gets copied when a new account is created at some other Stack Exchange, but not all. I'm not sure why. BTW, if you change the question to ""...is this guy on a mushroom trip??"", then the answer changes to ""Possibly, but that's still not why this profile sounds strangely out of context.""]</p>",,2012-03-04T17:06:10.030Z,2021-08-24T08:23:43.383Z,Lost in Cyberspace,11145,928,120,2449,https://i.stack.imgur.com/H7MzX.jpg,http://stackoverflow.com/users/1248365/adi-inbar

<h2>Second-Generation Books</h2>
<p>His most recent books have been focused on second-generation Android app development (Kotlin and the Android Jetpack):</p>
<ul>

</li>

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Things Other Than Books</h2>

403455,Jeff Axelrod,"<p>I'm an independent Android developer currently working on an educational application.  It's important to me to continuously improve development techniques so I can maximize the ""ilities"" of software I write (reliability, maintainability, testability, understandability, etc.)  </p>

<p>Here's a <a href=""http://www.theaxelrods.com/Tools%20and%20Technologies%20to%20Learn.html"" rel=""nofollow"">mind map of tools and technologies</a> I am presently using or investigating. You can click on hyperinks to bring you to related sites. </p>

<p>I'm particularly interested in using <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0470025700"" rel=""nofollow"">Model-Driven Software Development</a> to keep my architecture consistent and well documented.  I am not yet using Scala on Android for anything other than testing, but plan to eventually migrate to Scala for the application code.</p>

<p>Some of my favorite books:</p>

<ul>
<li>Effective Java <em>(Bloch)</em></li>
<li>Programming in Scala <em>(Ordesky)</em></li>
<li>Refactoring - Improving the Design of Existing Code <em>(Fowler et al)</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Some favorite tools:</p>

<ul>
<li>Eclipse</li>
<li>Guice + RoboGuice for dependency injection, though plan to replace this soon as startup is much too slow on Android</li>
<li>OrmLite (ORM that works well on Android)</li>
<li>Robotium for Android integration testing</li>
<li>Eclispe EMF for MDSD</li>
<li>Powermock + Mockito for mocking</li>

**Short Bio:** Throughout over 9 years of experience on mobile software development, I have acquired a deep understanding on how to overcome the real hurdles of developing performant, robust, testable and maintainable applications from the requirement analysis to the architecture, design, development, continuous integration and continuous deployment. I have a strong fascination for CLEAN coding and SOLID principles. Problem solving is my passion regardless if its design related or architectural and I value the passion for problem solving minds. Usability, especially user intuitive and interactive UX for front ends and fault tolerance for backends are my prime concerns on developing any product. More importantly I enjoy Software Engineering and solely believe that this profession suits best for me.

<p>I've started out as project manager building a little app with my uncle; then began developing for iOS my own (for iPad using Obj-C at the time); made some iPhone and iPad apps (Swift).<br>
Eventually we founded the Funeral Marketplace, for which I led the iOS development (Swift) and managed the web (react.js) &amp; backend (php, laravel) development. I then began developing for the frontend and backend as well, while also building my knowledge in server-side swift using the Vapor framework making me full-stack.</p>

Make sure to make the subject <em>specific</em> (I said: <strong><em>specific</em></strong>. Repeat: <strong>specific</strong> subject required). I can not stress this enough - 90% of you can not compose a specific subject, but instead use some generic subject. <i><b>Use a specific subject, damn it!</b></i> You still don't get it. It can't be that difficult to provide a specific subject to an email instead of a generic one. For example, including meta content like ""quick question"" is unhelpful. Concentrate on the actual subject. Did I say

<p>So yes! I'm an Android enthusiast, I like to make android apps and I'm a Professional Android Developer, Still other technological stuffs excites me but Android is top on that list.</p>

I've been visiting every day (it all started with a badge), and now I can't seem to stop - its an unhealthy addiction. I have grown tired of dealing with the ego and abrasive personalities that seem to pervade the industry, and on this site especially. People are not kind to each other, and this is not a nice place for anybody, newbie or expert alike. It has been a great professional resource, but its over for me!!! I have always been a self learner and able to find my own answers - like most competent developers, I will miss the convenience, but I'm capable of getting by without. Good bye.</p>

<p>Hopefully I can kick the habit for good..</p>

<p>About me..</p>

<p>I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and two years experience as a ""Software Engineer"" in medical device research and development. I'm proficient in a couple languages; Java, C++, Pascal. I've had a passing experience with countless others (but since I don't actively practice they are now mostly forgotten).</p>

<p>I've been coding since I was a kid - sometimes I do it for ""fun"" (but less and less). My first language was BASIC on an Apple II. Then I was really into ""softcoding"" for text based games (MU*), and then into ""web design"". My first programming class was in highschool; we were taught TurboPascal, followed by VisualBasic. </p>

<p>At university the languages used to teach computer science were C, Java, and Scheme. I also took a CIS course (through the college of business) where I learned some C# (but wasn't too impressed with the program; I would much rather ponder ""what is computable""). </p>

<p>In my brief professional experience I've worked mainly with C++ (Qt) and Delphi to create nice user interfaces. I had a brief experience with LAMP based webapps (and later with Spring 3 MVC). None of that really interests me (but thats what was required).</p>

<p>Currently I'm into Android development - its a hobby. I like to create things. I want those things to be useful. That work is available on fdroid (and the code on github).</p>",,2011-10-02T19:38:49.240Z,2017-11-06T22:18:11.870Z,Arizona,4082,1216,749,424,https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e07f41c11cd1d02830ccade93b35145c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1,https://sites.google.com/site/forrestguice/home
