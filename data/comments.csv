7667053,It's not about just contacts. The intent of my question is much more general. If there is no documentation then how do I know what data I get from an AlarmManager.set() or a registerReceiver(TelephonyManager.ACTION_PHONE_STATE_CHANGED) or ANY system broadcast or ANY system service or ANY system activity result.,2011-06-29T01:22:35.030Z,6474762,748317,,0

7650608,"I'll try one more time. THERE IS NO DOCUMENTATION. IT IS UNDOCUMENTED. YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO USE ANY UNDOCUMENTED EXTRAS. You can analyze a bundle, or you can look at the Android source code for the contacts app, but then it'll break on other contacts apps. You're only supposed to use getData() to retrieve the contact ID in the example you mentioned. There is documentation on what a bundle is, and how to use it, there is documentation on ACTION_PICK and startActivityForResult, but not for the particular bundle you get with ACTION_PICK on a contact, if any.",2011-06-28T08:24:01.790Z,6474762,345717,,0

This is meant to be used internally in your own app. Or, if it's essential to a callback, it will be documented. But if not, then not.",2011-06-28T05:00:19.387Z,6474762,345717,,0

You can try to be smart and use `Bundle.keySet` to see what's inside the Bundle after using Google's contacts app. But guess what: Chances are, HTC's contacts app returns a different bundle. Or MotoBlur. In your particular case, the only thing you can rely on is the intent's data, so read the result as outlined here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/866769/how-to-call-android-contacts-list ..

7610367,"A bundle is really just a container. It entirely depends on the app that packaged it up. If it's your own, then it's obvious - it's whatever you put in.

It's an open system that can be used by anyone (system and users), so you'll find extras specific to intents/classes in the respective documentation.",2011-06-29T03:13:41.310Z,6474762,345717,,0

And as the native twitter app uses it I think its fair to say it is a UI concept a large amount of people are familiar with.",2012-04-20T17:58:27.117Z,4605205,147226,,0

9430480,"@Rui I too used this method for the last year. It has now occurred to me though that this is also incorrect. Why would Google even have a Dialog if this was the way to 'fix' this issue? The problem I see is that if you open ActivityB (Theme.Dialog) from ActivityA then ActivityA is moved down on the Activity stack thus is marked as ready to kill by the OS if necessary. Therefore, if you have a long running process and are showing some sort of faux progress 'dialog' and it took too long and memory ran low... ActivityA is killed and there is nothing to come back too upon progress complete.",2011-10-13T00:47:18.720Z,2397205,520186,,0

You first want to add an item, but then what if you want to edit it later? you'd use the same activity, but when editing, you would change controls to the values  you feed in.   You don't want to create two activities for the same thing, so in the end you still would have to pass an extra in, in my case i pass in an int value equal to 100 for add, or 200 for edit, then work after that, since I can't pull the request code.",2014-08-10T05:27:32.630Z,7648277,965372,,0

The issue is that if you get the position using position == getBasicItemCount() it won't return true for the actual last position, but last position - 1. It ended up placing the FooterView there (not at the bottom).

It works fine when you get to Activity #3 - pressing Back closes the app. Pressing Back in Activity #2, however, should return you to #1 - but with this solution it just closes the app. Plus, as was already pointed out, when you for example request some permission on runtime, the Activity from which you were requesting it closes and doesn't reopen after the permission is granted/denied.

45739292,"@Sergey I agree, iterating over the list is not always necessary. However, sometimes you will want to process both checked and unchecked items. This method is also guaranteed to preserve the order of the checked items, which can be important for some use cases. Also, the number of items in a checkable list is limited by practicality: nobody is going to scroll through a list of thousands of items and check some off, so the performance gain is very small. I think the upsides outweigh the negligible performance decrease of iterating through the entire list.",2015-02-25T18:06:13.870Z,19414593,15882,,0

67700699,"@Nepster, true, but not always convenient. FWIW, The difference is that Replace removes ANY fragment(s) in the container; don't need to know `thisFragment`. One scenario where this matters is if Fragment A links to Fragment B1 which is replaced by Fragment B2. THEN if want ""Back"" button to go back to Fragment A (instead of to B1), we have to code that manually, because Android's back will [incorrectly IMHO] do ""remove B1, add A"" - the opposite of the original link from A to B1. B2 lurks in viewbehind. Our code has to know that B2 is the current fragment, not B1. Sometimes that is inconvenient.",2016-10-24T12:42:14.660Z,14362709,199364,,0

Also if i wanted to have a long swipe so that i can directly delete the item what would be the approach ?",2018-06-26T21:23:39.600Z,45062745,5712681,,0

6213373,"Yes, I think it's wrong. As you say, the `Activity` has a reference to the `Dialog`. When the configuration is changed, the first `Activity` is destroyed, which means all fields are set to `null`. But the low-level `WindowManager` also has a reference to the `Dialog` (since it is has not been dismissed yet). The new `Activity` tries to create a new `Dialog` (in `preExecute()`) and the window manager raises a fatal exception preventing you from doing so. Indeed, if it does so, there would be no way to cleanly destroy the `Dialog` hence keeping a reference to the initial `Activity`. Am I right?",2011-03-29T21:20:28.893Z,4143724,94363,,0

I have a fragment that basically has a `NestedScrollView` (with a `LinearLayout` as child) inside a `CoordinatorLayout` that sets `app:layout_behavior=""@string/bottom_sheet_behavior""`. Sometimes, for instance when the host activity of the fragment was paused and resumed later on, the `NestedScrollView` did not scroll to the top layout of its child (i.e. `LinearLayout`), but was strangely offset. Setting `android:descendantFocusability=""blocksDescendants""` to the `LinearLayout`solved my problem :)",2020-05-26T13:20:35.623Z,44898417,2350644,,0

12648133,"@Jakobud - yes, the problem is that a supertype cannot implement a wildcard (`?`). However, what I would do instead is make an AsyncTask for each type. Since there probably would be code duplication, you can create a common base class to inherit from. Also, you *could* just pass in plain old `Object` and use `instanceof` to cast appropriately... though, this is probably not a good solution, since you are fighting Java at that point. - Finally, you can set the params as `Void` and use custom member fields instead. These could be passed in to the object using a different method for each type.",2012-03-28T16:49:42.827Z,9901943,186636,,0
12648651,Can you simply create a constructor for the AsynTask that takes whatever parameters you want? Or does this class not really work that way?

12652028,"@Jakobud - The point of the first type - String - in your example, is to let `execute()` know what type you will be passing to it. You can use `Void` if you will not be passing anything, since you set things up earlier. `execute()` is still useful in this case, since it starts things off.... `<Void,` is useful because you declare that you will pass nothing to `execute()`. So, you shouldn't set it to `String` if you will not use it, set it to `Void` in that case.",2012-03-28T19:41:48.123Z,9901943,186636,,0

12648750,"@Jakobud - Yes, you can make the constructor whatever you want. That's a good place to pass in values for class members. You can also make setter methods to set those class members (so they're not public - this will increase your code's flexibility).

5040710,"Sure, try this one: http://www.softwarepassion.com/android-series-custom-listview-items-and-adapters/ Also, just search here for ""custom listview"", there's a wealth of information on the topic. Basically, you create your own version of a ListAdapter that you will pass a list of Taxi objects to, and in that adapter, you specify how to handle the Taxi object. For example, you have two TextViews: `taxi` and `address`. You'll tell the adapter to set `address.setText()` with the `.getAddress()` method of your `Taxi` object class.",2011-01-03T22:50:57.213Z,4587651,321697,,0

Of course, this is assuming that your content will not contain any commas. Since you have an address field, you'll likely need commas, in which case you could use something like a pipe (|) for a delimiter. I don't think Excel lets you choose your delimiter, though...but you could always use tab-delimited and then do a find > replace tabs with pipes. Then...",2011-01-03T19:49:59.610Z,4587651,321697,,0

Without scrollview you wont be able to scroll through a complex long xml based form for e.g a long data entry form with dozens of fields one below another and one of them being a SupportMapFragment maybe to enter location. If you add a scrollview to the root of this layout, then you can scroll the form to view all fields, else you cant.

18364376,Interesting Vinay. Haven't noticed the app being any more resource heavy (it's pretty lightweight anyway at the moment). What have you found? I view a service as a predictable environment for letting the system get on with some heavy lifting or I/O regardless of the UI state. Communicating with the service to see when something has completed seemed 'right'. The services I start to execute a bit of work stop on the task's completion so typically survive around 10-30s.,2012-11-17T20:06:55.437Z,11628709,1348379,,0

41549579,"That is one option, cleaner. Be sure to offset notify* methods accordingly. Depending on your codebase, you may also prefer to create a HeaderAdapter that gets a normal adapter as a constructor parameter and forwards API calls to that one. In that case, you can add your HeaderAdapter as a listener to the wrapped adapter so that you can override and dispatch notify events. It all depends on your use case.

So add this removeItem() method to your adapter, and make your ViewHolder class to implement onClickListener interface, and handle click events in overridden  onClick method of your ViewHolder class. Also if you are populating recycler view from database, don't forget to delete corresponding

While this will be sufficient for most use cases, if the size of a divider is large, it will at the very least be pretty ugly to have your RecyclerView extend to an unnecessary length, just to accommodate the last unneeded divider.
If e.g. you would instead let the Adapter add LayoutParams with a margin in onBindViewHolder, then you could exclude the first/last element respectively and would only have a divider between two elements.

i guess you are doing some long processing after starting new activity..

Although I do not agree with the reasoning about the risks of this approach, I reviewed the question and answers.
Although the question was aiming at a solution like mine, thats now how it was written. Reason for that was my then lack of understanding kotlin, android and coroutines. That inexperience led me to ask for coroutines specifically.
As you said, this question is popular and my solution does not involve coroutines.
My initial intent and the exact wording of the question are very different. However, the wording is what counts. So I will reassign accepted solution. Thanks!",2020-06-29T14:43:35.977Z,62628833,4687402,,0

44958200,"@Till I would disagree. The very fact that _Navigating to screens with multiple entry points_ is listed as a separate item indicates that it is a special case, not general behaviour. As such, overriding `onBackPressed` should be the exception (and yes, is occasionally valid) rather than the rule - but all of the other answers treat this as the common solution, hence me stressing this point in my answer. An app that _commonly_ has screens without a strict position within the hierarchy would be hell to navigate.

At the first glance it looks great, but this approach doesn't count with the scenario if one needs to update the item e.g. `onClick`. In such situation the behavior is unspecified (a bit of a mess) because the items which were not clicked also updates their UI. This happens because the items share the same `View` instance. The aforementioned `Integer.MAX_VALUE % 2` approach might not be the cleanest one from the coding point of view, but works for this scenario.",2020-03-29T15:38:45.950Z,60271665,915756,,1

By making the ProgressDialog created with each Activity, we ensure that this new ProgressDialog isn't killed along with the old Activity.

I also made sure that the ProgressDialog is set to null whenever it's dismissed (to aid garbage collection).

Going via the parent activity is much neater because you can leave it to the activity to decide where to get the data from. For example on a phone your activity might use fragments X and Y, but on a tablet you might decide to use X and Z. Better to let the Activity (which knows what fragments exist) act as middle man and connect to Y or Z as appropriate.",2013-01-14T15:28:14.110Z,14049551,757471,,2

11153978,"@stevemoseley : u r wrong. Because onSaveInstanceState is called to retrieve per-instance state from an activity before being killed. If the activity is not killed(it is placed in background) then it is not necessary to store INSTANCE VALUES in onPause() since these values are not cleared from memory. When the app is brought in front the values are there for use. BUT in case if system closes the app to free memory, the instance values will be destroyed and onPause can not be used to retrieve them. Thus it makes sense to use onSaveInstanceState to store instance values and not the onPause.",2012-01-18T19:39:48.833Z,2909211,814548,,2

Its worth supporting, for minimal OS resources, but if an app wants to return the user to the state they were in, no matter how the app was exited, it is necessary to use a persistent storage approach instead. I use onCreate to check for bundle, and if it is missing, then check persistent storage. This centralizes the decision making. I can recover from a crash, or back button exit or custom menu item Exit, or get back to screen user was on many days later.",2015-09-19T10:38:42.980Z,2909211,199364,,2

34674051,I think that as the uses of fragments has been expanded the original idea of not using direct fragment communication breaks down. E.g. in a navigation drawer each immediate child fragment of the activity is roughly acting as an activity.

In fact there doesn't seem to be any nice way to encapsulate dialogfragment to allow it to work with both activities and fragments in a reusable way.,2014-03-30T18:38:21.073Z,19452414,1137254,,3

16376401,@towpse The reason he has the helper class structured as it is is to avoid a crash due to non-backward compatibility. The method `invalidateOptionsMenu()` only exists in API 11 (honeycomb) and up. So if your app is to run on anything lower than API 11 it will crash. To avoid this you wrap the method in question in another **static** method (e.g. `refreshActionBarMenu()`) and **only** call this static method if you're running on API>11 (thus the version check _before_ you call the static method). This works because the `VersionHelper` class isn't loaded until you actually use it.,2012-08-31T21:18:21.627Z,7814662,708906,,10
